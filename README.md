### Hi, I'm Ben 👋

I started my journey into development in mid-2021, mainly through resources such as theodinproject.com. Four months later, I enrolled in the academic web development program at the University of Applied Sciences Technikum Wien, which I successfully completed in February 2023. Having entered this field relatively late, I am currently focusing on bridging the gap and gaining a deeper understanding of the underlying principles of computer science while actively exploring the latest technologies in web development. I have worked with TypeScript, JavaScript, React, Next.js, among others. I am currently particularly interested in compilers and interpreters, as my goal is, true to the first principle of 'a pragmatic programmer', to take care of my craft.
