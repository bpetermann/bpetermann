### Hi, I'm Ben 👋

My journey into development started in mid-2021, mainly through resources such as theodinproject. Four months later, I enrolled in the academic web development program at the University of Applied Sciences Technikum Wien, which I successfully completed in February 2023. 

I have worked with TypeScript, JavaScript, React, and Next.js, among others.
