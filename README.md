### Hi, I'm Ben 👋

My journey into development started in mid-2021, mainly through resources such as theodinproject.com. Four months later, I enrolled in the academic web development program at the University of Applied Sciences Technikum Wien, which I successfully completed in February 2023. 

I have worked with TypeScript, JavaScript, React, and Next.js, among others. 

Having entered this field relatively late, I am currently focusing on bridging the gap and gaining a deeper understanding of the underlying principles of computer science while actively exploring the latest technologies in web development. I am particularly interested in compilers and interpreters.
